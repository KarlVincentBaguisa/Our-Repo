                <h1>Rizals Life: Family, Childhood and Early Education</h1>
                <p>Jose Rizal (Jose Protacio Mercado Rizal y Alonso Realonda) was born on June 19, 1861  at  Calamba,  Laguna. According  to  some  readings,  his mother nearly diedduring   his   delivery   because   of   his   big   head.   Three   days   after   his   birth,   Rizal   wasbaptized on June 22 of the said year with the name Jose Rizal Mercado at the Catholicchurch of Calamba by the parish priest Rev. Rufino Collantes. He was the seventh childof Francisco Mercado Rizal and Teodora Alonso y Quintos. <br><br>
                    During 1865-1867, his mother taught him how to read and write. At the age ofthree, Rizal mastered and learned the alphabet taught by his mother. At a very youngage, he has shown great interest in reading. He enjoyed reading books in their library athome, with his mother who acts as his reading teacher and a critic. At this time, he alsolearned how to pray and even read the bible. <br><br></p>

            <div class="about-col">
                <p style="padding-top: 0px;">When Jose Rizal grew older, his parents acquired private tutors to give himlessons at home in preparation for his formal education. One of them was Leon Monroy,a classmate of his father who taught him the rudiments of Latin. At about this time, hismother’s cousin, Uncle Manuel Alberto, who frequently visited the family in Calamba,was worried about his nephew’s physical development. He then taught Rizal to developthe skills in swimming, fencing, wrestling and other sports, while Uncle Jose taught himto love and admire the beauty of nature. On the other hand, Uncle Gregorio, a scholar,has instilled in Rizal’s mind the love for education and its importance, the value of hardwork, to think for himself, and to observe his surroundings carefully. <br><br>
                    When he was four years old, his sister Concepcion, the eighth child in the Rizalfamily, died at the age of three. This was the first time he cried as a young boy. As sadas   he   was,   the   parish   priest   of   Calamba,   Father   Leoncio   Lopez,   helped   Rizalunderstand the philosophy of life and learned the value of scholarship and intellectualhonesty. <br><br>
                    Rizal,   in   his   childhood,   used   to   take   long   rides   through   all   the   surroundingcountry by riding his pony that his father gave him. Among his pets were doves and adog. <br><br>
                    Owing  to   the   continuous   teaching   of   Doña  Teodora, Rizal   was   persuaded   toexpress his feelings through verses. He was able to write his first poem when he waseight   years   old.   The   poem   was   entitled   “Sa  Aking   Mga   Kababata”   (To   My   FellowChildren),  which   showed that  Rizal,   even at  a   young age,  already had  love   for his country. Here, he similarly incorporates the love for the native language with God’s giftof freedom. He compared his native language or Tagalog to Latin, English and Spanish.Tagalog,  like   any   other languages, had its  own   alphabet and system  writing, whichaccording to Rizal, disappeared because they were neglected or ignored. With this, heencourages his fellow children to love their native tongue. <br><br>
                    Then, after Rizal’s tutor Leon Monroy died, his parents decided to transfer Rizalto   a   private   school   in   Biñan,   Laguna.   He   was   accompanied   by   his   older   brotherPaciano, who acted as his second father during his school days in Biñan. The schoolwas then supervised by Maestro Justiniano Aquino Cruz.</p>

        <div class="row" style="margin-top: 0%; margin-bottom: 30px;">
            <div class="about-col">
                <p style="padding-top: 0px;">Rizal’s first day of class in the school was not easy. The maestro asked him if heknows how to speak Latin or Spanish, but in response, he only knew a little of thelanguages. As a result, one of his classmates named Pedro, the son of the maestro,laughed at him. Pedro was always bullying him that eventually resulted to a brawl. Butknowing Rizal’s acquired knowledge and skill in the art of wrestling from his Tio Manuel,he defeated Pedro. After the said incident, Rizal became popular in his class. Here,Rizal was able to show his intellectual superiority. <br><br>
                    He excelled in his class in Latin, Spanish and other subjects in the curriculum forelementary pupils. Because of this, many of the students became jealous to him and doeverything to destroy Rizal’s name to Maestro Cruz. While Rizal’s interest in paintingwas nurtured early on by an old painter named Juancho of Biñan. During this time,knowledge was taught  in the  minds  of  the students  by doing  tedious  memorizationmethod. Despite some lack of the elementary education in Spanish system, Rizal wasable to have the needed instruction preparatory for college work in Manila.</p>

    <p style="font-style: italic;">Whenever people of a country truly love<br>
        The language, which by heaven they were taught to use<br>
        That country also surely liberty pursue<br>
        As does the bird which soars to freer space above.<br><br>

        For language is the final judge and referee<br>
        Upon the people in the land where it holds sway;<br>
        In truth our human race resembles this way<br>
        The other living beings born in liberty.<br><br>
    
        Whoever knows not how to love his native tongue<br>
        Is worse than any beast or evil smelling fish.<br>
        To make our language richer ought to be our wish<br>
        The same as any mother loves to feed her young.<br><br>
    
        Tagalog and the Latin language are the same<br>
        And English and Castilian and the angel’s tongue;<br>
        And God, whose watchful care o’er all is flung,<br>
        Has given us His blessing in the speech we claim.<br><br>
    
        Our mother tongue, like all the highest that we know<br>
        Had alphabet and letters of its very own;</p>
